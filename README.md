# Load Optimization Software

This project aims to develop a sophisticated system for maximizing cargo space utilization within trucks during loading. By inputting cargo dimensions, the system will recommend suitable truck types, quantities, and optimal loading configurations, all while minimizing wasted space. The primary goal is to streamline cargo consolidation, reduce excess truck usage, and provide clear, pictorial results. The system will handle diverse truck types, dimensions, and weight limits, with API integration.
